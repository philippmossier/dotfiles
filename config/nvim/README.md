## differences between wsl and mac:

### lspconfig for jdtls/java-lsp

Change some paths accordingly to your machine:

- `workspace_dir`: normaly nvim share folder like `/Users/phil/.local/share/nvim/jdtls_lsp_workspaces/`
- `"/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-17.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java",`
- `"/Users/phil/.local/share/nvim/mason/packages/jdtls/plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_1.6.400.v20210924-0641.jar"`
- `"/Users/phil/.local/share/nvim/mason/packages/jdtls/config_mac"`

### copilot

maybe you have to relogin into copilot via `:Copilot` and then select the action.
