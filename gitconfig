# ================== how to use credential helper ==================
# DOCS link: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-credential-store
# The .git-credentials file is stored in plaintext. Each credential is stored on its own line as a URL like:
# https://user:pass@example.com
# Note: some special signs inside passwords have to be url encoded, for example # should be %23)
# No other kinds of lines (e.g. empty lines or comment lines) are allowed in the file, even though some may be silently ignored. Do not view or edit the file with editors.
# When Git needs authentication for a particular URL context, credential-store will consider that context a pattern to match against each entry in the credentials file. 
# If the protocol, hostname, and username (if we already have one) match, then the password is returned to Git.

# COMMAND to init git with your .git-credentials file:
# git config --global credential.helper 'store --file ~/.git-credentials'
# ==================================================================
